NAME
    IO::AIO::LoadLimited - A tiny IO::AIO extension that allows to load
    multiple files

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use IO::AIO;
        use IO::AIO::LoadLimited;

        my @files = (...);
        my $grp = aio_group sub { ... };
        aio_load_limited $grp, 10, @files, sub {
            my ($file, $content) = @_;

            warn "could not read $file: $!" unless defined $content;
            # whatever is neccessary...
            ...
        };

EXPORT
    IO::AIO::LoadLimited exports aio_load_limited.

SUBROUTINES
    aio_load_limited $group, $limit, @files, $cb;
        The function aio_load_limited loads a list of files asynchronously
        where the number of open filehandles used are limited so you don't
        hit the hard limit of your operating system. The limit is archived
        using the group and limit functionality of "IO::AIO". The callback
        $cb gets invoked once for each file with the filename as the first
        parameter and the content of the file as the second. If the file can
        not be opened or read the content is "undef".
