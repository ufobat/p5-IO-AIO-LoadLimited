VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use IO::AIO;
        use IO::AIO::LoadLimited;

        my @pathnames = ( '/path/to/file', ...);
        my $group = aio_group sub { ... };
        my $limit = 10;
        aio_load_limited @pathnames, sub {
            my ($pathname, $content) = @_;

            warn "could not read $pathname: $!" unless defined $content;
            # whatever is neccessary...
            ...
        }, $group, $limit;

    or

        aio_load_limited @pathnames, sub {
            my ($pathname, $content) = @_;

            warn "could not read $pathname: $!" unless defined $content;
            # whatever is neccessary...
            ...
        }, sub {
             # done cb
        };

        IO::AIO::flush; # or use AnyEvent::AIO

EXPORT
    IO::AIO::LoadLimited exports aio_load_limited.

SUBROUTINES
    aio_load_limited @files, $cb, $group_or_donecb, $limit = 10;
        The function aio_load_limited loads a list of files asynchronously
        where the number of open filehandles used are limited so you don't
        hit the hard limit of your operating system. The limit is archived
        using the group and limit functionality of "IO::AIO". The callback
        $cb gets invoked once for each file with the pathname as the first
        parameter and the content of the file as the second. If the file can
        not be opened or read the content is "undef". The third parameter
        $group_or_donecb is either another callback that thats called when
        everthing is done or an IO::AIO::GRP object. The last parameter
        $limit is optional, its default value is 10.;
